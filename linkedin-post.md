Hey everyone,

I'm excited to announce 𝗦𝗲𝗿𝘃𝗲𝗿𝗹𝗲𝘀𝘀 𝗠𝘆𝗦𝗤𝗟 𝘃𝟮.𝟭.𝟬 is now available! 🚀

Serverless MySQL solves a critical problem in serverless architectures: managing MySQL connections at scale. When your serverless functions scale to handle thousands of concurrent requests, they can quickly exhaust your database connection limits. This module intelligently manages those connections, preventing the dreaded "Too many connections" errors while providing a clean async/await interface.

𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁'𝘀 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗶𝗻 𝘃𝟮.𝟭.𝟬

- 𝗤𝘂𝗲𝗿𝘆 𝗥𝗲𝘁𝗿𝗶𝗲𝘀 𝗦𝘂𝗽𝗽𝗼𝗿𝘁 ✨
  Automatically retry failed queries for transient errors like deadlocks and timeouts. Configure max retries and backoff strategies to make your applications more resilient.

- 𝗦𝗤𝗟 𝗤𝘂𝗲𝗿𝘆 𝗟𝗼𝗴𝗴𝗶𝗻𝗴 📝
  Enable `returnFinalSqlQuery` to see the exact SQL being executed with parameter values substituted. This makes debugging much easier, especially when queries fail.

- 𝗖𝗵𝗮𝗻𝗴𝗲𝗨𝘀𝗲𝗿 𝗦𝘂𝗽𝗽𝗼𝗿𝘁 🔄
  Switch database users or databases on existing connections without reconnecting, perfect for multi-tenant applications or when you need different permission levels.

- 𝗖𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗿𝗲𝗵𝗲𝗻𝘀𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝗜𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗴𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗧𝗲𝘀𝘁𝘀 🧪
  We've added extensive integration tests to ensure reliability across different MySQL versions and environments. Our CI pipeline now tests against multiple MySQL versions to guarantee compatibility.

𝗪𝗵𝘆 𝗦𝗲𝗿𝘃𝗲𝗿𝗹𝗲𝘀𝘀 𝗠𝘆𝗦𝗤𝗟?

- 𝗦𝗺𝗮𝗿𝘁 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝗻𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗠𝗮𝗻𝗮𝗴𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁: Monitors connection usage and automatically manages them to prevent exhaustion.

- 𝗕𝘂𝗶𝗹𝘁 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗦𝗰𝗮𝗹𝗲: Tested with 500+ concurrent connections using only 90 available MySQL connections - with zero errors!

- 𝗦𝗶𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗶𝗳𝗶𝗲𝗱 𝗧𝗿𝗮𝗻𝘀𝗮𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀: Chain queries with a clean, fluent API that makes transactions easy to understand and maintain.

- 𝗠𝗼𝗱𝗲𝗿𝗻 𝗔𝗣𝗜: Full async/await support eliminates callback hell and simplifies error handling.

Whether you're using AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, or Azure Functions with RDS, Aurora, or any MySQL-compatible database, Serverless MySQL makes your database interactions more reliable and efficient.
