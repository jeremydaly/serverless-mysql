# Serverless MySQL v2.1.0 Thumbnail Design

Based on the Serverless MySQL logo, I'll create a professional thumbnail design that highlights the v2.1.0 release:

## Design Elements:

  - A magnifying glass for SQL query logging
  - A user switch icon for changeUser support
  - A test tube/lab icon for integration tests
- **Tagline**: "Connection Management at Serverless Scale" in a smaller font below the logo

## Color Scheme:
- Black: #000000 (for "Serverless" text)

- White space to ensure clean, modern look

## Layout:
